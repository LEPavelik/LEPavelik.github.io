  <h2>Voyant Tools -</h2>
  <h3>Word Cloud</h3>
<p>The word cloud tool found in Voyant helped show me some of the most commonly used words among all of the texts in my corpus. Across all of them, the terms “nos” and “00” were two of the most commonly seen. Nos took the lead, as it was seen in my texts 853 times, but it was mostly found in the text from Mark Campbell. After doing some research, I found out that “00” was found when listing dollar amounts of certain hair items, and “nos” was used to describe the number of something. For example, it references the different strands of hair that are used while braiding as section Nos. 1 or section Nos. 3 so that the reader had a better visual.</p>
<p>While it was interesting to see how often these terms were used in my texts, I decided to add them into my “stopwords” list, which ultimately removed them from my word cloud completely. I felt as if these terms were not super important to my corpus overall. After making this change, the word “braid” become my most commonly seen term, as it was used 648 times.</p>
<p>It was additionally fascinating to see how many of the most common words came from the text from Mark Campbell, which Voyant also described as being the longest in length of all of my texts. To be more specific, the Mark Campbell text was 42,022 words long while the shortest was Claudia Kidwell’s text at 18,056 words long. Although I have not read this text in great detail, I assume that there are so many repeated words and phrases due to the fact that it talks about one repeating subject: braids. There are only so many terms you can use when describing the same concept over and over again.</p>
<p>Being that the text from Mark Campbell is so long when compared to the others, it makes sense that Voyant is also showing that it is the one with the largest number of average words per sentence. This text contains roughly about 34.3 words per sentence while the others range from 19.0-27.5 words per sentence.</p>
<p>Thinking back to the word cloud, it was easy for me to skim over the words used in the collage and pick out the terms in the text that I decided to encode. For my encoded text from my corpus, I decided to go with the one by Florence Mary Gardiner which is titled “The Evolution of Fashion”. I felt like I should look closer into this text specifically because it had a title that interested me and was conveniently organized in chapter structure. Some of the words from the word cloud that I could easily tell were from this text were “silk”, “sleeve”, “skirt”, and more!</p>
