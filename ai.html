      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>For this project, I wanted my AI bot to act as my personal best friend. It is important to note that I had a version of a friend in mind that fits my personal needs only, and did not attempt to cater to the general population of people. The characteristics and dialogue that I find appealing in a friend or companion may not align with everyone else’s.</p>
      <p>In order to make this drastic change from “Eliza” to what I renamed to  “Tessa”, I added in characteristics to humanize the robot. For example, someone who is my friend may refer to me as “girl” or “bestie”, so I sprinkled that language throughout the code in order to give Tessa a more conversational feeling. I also strived to get rid of the amount of interrogative questions that the AI was asking to make it less like a therapy session and more like a friendly and casual conversation.</p>
      <p>After all of the changes I made, Tessa is definitely someone that I would want to have as a friend. She is very upbeat and happy, as suggested by the constant usage of exclamation marks in her code. Not only this, but Tessa’s responses look to be supportive and insightful, which are qualities that any good friend should have. Tessa has a set of multiple responses that she can pick from depending on which keywords somebody decides to type, ensuring that the conversation varies from time to time. When compared to the original AI, “Eliza”, who simply asked closed-ended questions with no resolution or end goal, Tessa tries to provide helpful answers that leave the person on the other side of the screen feeling fulfilled.</p>
