      <h3> <em>Welcome</em> to my digital projects showcase!</h3>
      <p> I have almost exclusively worked with Adobe Photoshop for school related projects in the past, so I will be including these images here!</p>

<h2>Photo Restoration</h2>
<h3>Where Project Was Made: GD100</h3>
<h3>When Project Was Made: Sophomore Year - First Semester</h3>
<p>This project is titled Photo Restoration, and was an assignment in my Graphic Design course. For this assignment, we needed to take an old, crinkled image and make it look brand new again. In order to do this, I utilized many of Adobe Photoshop's tools such as the quick selection tool, the paint brush tool, and the healing brush tool. While we were provided with this original photo for the project, this assignment showed me how I can work this sort of magic on my own old photographs at home!</p>

<h2>Blended Image</h2>
<h3>Where Project Was Made: GD100</h3>
<h3>When Project Was Made: Sophomore Year - First Semester</h3>
<p>These two photos were a part of the Blended Image Project that I completed in my Graphic Design course. This assignment instructed us to find different images (specifically of animals in this case) and blend them together to make one nicely flowing photo. I decided to go ahead and add different animal heads to the bodies of different animal species. After using the techniques I learned in class, these were the two images that I produced!</p>

<h2>Goodwill Ad</h2>
<h3>Where Project Was Made: GD100</h3>
<h3>When Project Was Made: Sophomore Year - First Semester</h3>
<p>I decided to make a Goodwill ad for our Advertisement Project in Graphic Design! This project demonstrated that I knew how to use different techniques in order to import fonts, make fonts stand out on an image, and appeal to an audience's emotions. I decided to go with a more "sappy" advertisemet, leading customers to shop at Goodwill. I ultimately decided to go with the specific company of Goodwill because of my own personal deep love and appreciation for thrifting.</p>

<h2>Penn State Berks Banner</h2>
<h3>Where Project Was Made: GD100</h3>
<h3>When Project Was Made: Sophomore Year - First Semester</h3>
<p>This image was what I created as part of the Penn State Banner Project in Graphic Design! This assignment showcases my ability to easily blend images and change their color properties. It also proves my skills in areas such as being able to bring multiple photo sources together, remove backgrounds from different images, and make images appear more or less opaque.</p>
